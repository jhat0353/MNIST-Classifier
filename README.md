# MNIST-Classifier

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform multi-task categorization of digit color and type.
Only colors green, red, and blue are used for simplicity.
Blue digits are much harder for humans to identify
Images are made more challenging for the model by a high ratio of random noise.
